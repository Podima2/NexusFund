# üåê NexusFund

**The cross-chain crowdfunding dApp for the next generation of global projects.**

NexusFund lets anyone launch or support campaigns with stablecoins from any blockchain. Using Avail Nexus SDK's `bridgeAndExecute()`, contributors can seamlessly pledge funds cross-chain‚Äîno matter where their assets are held. All pledges are securely bridged and held in escrow on a single chain, ensuring transparent, atomic release or refund of funds when campaign goals are met or missed.

Campaign Logic: deposit(), release(), refund()

```

- Smart contract deployed on one chain (e.g., Base Sepolia).  
- `bridgeAndExecute()` handles bridging and execution in one transaction.  
- Escrow contract tracks campaign status and contributor balances.

## üìù Smart Contract Overview

**Deployed Address (Base Sepolia):**  
[`0x4951992d46fa57c50Cb7FcC9137193BE639A9bEE`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x4951992d46fa57c50Cb7FcC9137193BE639A9bEE)

The core escrow contract is deployed on a single chain (e.g., Base Sepolia) and manages all campaign logic and funds in USDC (6 decimals). It is designed for seamless cross-chain pledges via Avail Nexus.

### Campaign Struct
```solidity
struct Campaign {
    address creator;     // Campaign owner
    uint256 goal;        // Target USDC amount (in 1e6 units)
    uint256 pledged;     // Current pledged amount
    uint256 deadline;    // UNIX timestamp deadline
    bool released;       // Whether funds have been released
    string title;        // Campaign title
    string description;  // Detailed description
    string category;     // Category (e.g. "Art", "Tech")
    string imageUrl;     // URL for campaign image
    string[] tags;       // Tags for search & categorization
}
```

### Main Functions
- `createCampaign(goal, durationSeconds, title, description, category, imageUrl, tags)`  
  Create a new campaign with metadata and a funding goal.
- `deposit(id, amount)`  
  Pledge USDC to a campaign. Can be called via cross-chain bridge.
- `release(id)`  
  Release funds to the creator/admin if the campaign is successful (goal met, deadline passed).
- `refund(id)`  
  Refund contributors if the campaign fails (goal not met, deadline passed).
- `getAllCampaigns()`  
  Returns all campaigns and their metadata.

All funds are held in escrow until the campaign is finalized (released or refunded). The contract is compatible with Avail Nexus cross-chain bridging and execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ‚â•14 + npm  
- Hardhat / Foundry (any Solidity dev framework)  
- Metamask (or other Web3 wallet) configured with testnets (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Podima2/NexusFund
cd NexusFund
npm install
```

### 2. Deploy Smart Contract

Configure network and campaign in:

* `hardhat.config.js`
* `.env`

Run deployment:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <escrowChain>
```

### 3. Configure Frontend

Copy `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env` and add:

```
REACT_APP_ESCROW_ADDRESS=<deployed_contract_address>
REACT_APP_NEXUS_API=<nexus_rpc_endpoint>
```

Install & start frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üß≠ Usage

### Pledge Funds

Select your source chain and pledge amount, then click **Pledge**. This triggers:

```js
await nexus.bridgeAndExecute({
  srcChain,
  destChain: ESCROW_CHAIN,
  token: "USDC",
  amount: pledgeAmount,
  targetContract: escrowAddress,
  encodedCallData: escrowInterface.encodeFunctionData("deposit", [campaignId, pledgeAmount])
});
```

### Release Funds

After goal is reached, click **Release Funds**, invoking:

```js
await nexus.bridgeAndExecute({
  srcChain: ESCROW_CHAIN,
  destChain: RECIPIENT_CHAIN,
  token: "USDC",
  amount: totalPledged,
  targetContract: escrowAddress,
  encodedCallData: escrowInterface.encodeFunctionData("release", [campaignId])
});
```
